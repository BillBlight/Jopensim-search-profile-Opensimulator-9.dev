This is a fork of PART of jOpenSim the great component for Joomla/Opensimulator.

There has been little movement on the .9 dev front for getting the search module to work, so I created this.

And then I went ahead and did the profile module as well..

This is soooo very much ALPHA , please be kind.

I have included a modded prebuild.xml as well as the source code I modified.

The original source code is available at, http://www.jopensim.com/jopensim/downloads1
and is included with the main download.

To build this put it in your source directory with the file structure as it is present here, and being in the root of your opensimulator source tree.

I provide no waranty and cannot say this will not blow up your opensim, but it is working for me.
